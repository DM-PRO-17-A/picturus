* Notes on different languages/versions of Python
I've considered a few different languages and compilers to use for the final implementation. 
I'll try to list a few pros and cons

** Cython
Python that gets compiled to C code
*** Pros
    Quite powerful
    Should be easy to write
*** Cons
    Bit of a chore to set up
    Hard to include various libraries (like numpy)

** numba
Adds a Just In Time (JIT) compiler for portions of your code
*** Pros
    Easy to write, basically just adding a line here and there
    Can be used with most (all?) libraries
    Can lead to very significant speedups
*** Cons
    Also a chore to set up, quite large downloads
    Not sure how reliable the speedup is, i.e. how easy 
        it is to consistently get a good increase
    Can be hard to work out how to use properly

** Pypy
Complete JIT for Python

I think this looks like the best option. It's easy to use, has very decent performance, and can somewhat easily use other libraries

*** Pros
    Easy to set up
    Easy to use (just write normal Python)
    Can use most libraries
    Good speedups
    Very reliable speedups
*** Cons
    Some work to set up libraries
    Not as good speedups as with numba (haven't compared to 
    Cython)

** C/C++
Low-level, compiled languages by default
*** Pros
    Very powerful and high performance
    Very well documented
    A ridiculous amount of libraries available
*** Cons
    Somewhat hard to use (well)
    Lots to learn for people who aren't used to them
    Many things aren't as straightforward as in Python

*** Interfacing
    We need to interface between the main script and the other components
**** Camera
    OpenCV script implemented in Python? Very easy to do if so. If it's done in C/C++, look at next part
**** FPGA and QNN
    The FPGA receives images by pushing images to a queue. This is done through a C++ program(?)
    
    Calling C++ from Python is doable, but requires libraries, for example:

    https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html

    http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/index.html

    http://swig.org

    At a glance, I think ctypes looks the most promising, but some seem to think that SWIG is the best for small stuff
**** Daughter card
    Communication over UART. This has been before, even with the Pynq-Z1. Should be quite easy(TM)

    PySerial (import serial)
