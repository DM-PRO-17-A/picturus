* Notes on things to remember and consider
  General notes on topics that are important to remember
  Kind of a TODO
** Centered pictures
   It seems that the QNN struggles a lot with recognising signs that aren't completely
   within the 32x32 picture
   It is not enough that it is centered, the sign must also be within the
   boundaries of the picture
** Test pictures
   Need to create different versions of the pictures of the signs to test with
*** Variations
    Rotation
    From the side
    Out on the egdes/less visible
** Overview
   Ane will draw pictures of the overview of the simulation
** Seize the means of production
   Get pictures from the camera when that part is ready
** Observations
   Size and brightness is less important than centered traffic signs
   QNN har godt nattesyn!
